# orchestra-metamodel

## Overview
This project provides a UML meta-model of FIX Orchestra. Users may use the model and generated code for model-driven development.

The model was generated from the Orchestra XML schema by Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). 

### Source Schema
The XML schema upon which this project is based is in project [fix-orchestra](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fix-orchestra). The initial implementation is based on Orchestra Release Candidate 3.

### Eclipse Modeling Project
The only prerequisite to use this project is installation of Eclipse Modeling Framework and XML Schema plug-ins for Eclipse.

Models, diagrams and code were generated using [Eclipse Modeling Framework](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/).

> The EMF project is a modeling framework and code generation facility for building tools and other applications based on a structured data model. 

The model is in Ecore, an implementation of OMG's [Meta Object Facility](https://www.omg.org/spec/MOF/) (MOF). 

> The Meta Object Facility (MOF) provides an open and platform-independent metadata management framework and associated
set of metadata services to enable the development and interoperability of model and metadata driven systems.
